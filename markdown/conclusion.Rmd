# Conclusion

Through this project, we have demonstrated that computational analysis can be made accessible to a wide range of biologists by providing an interactive environment. It is important to recognize that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach for proteomics datasets. Therefore, our application offers easy-to-interpret visualizations that allow users to assess the patterns and trends in their observed datasets. The default options provided in the application are based on successful analysis pipelines such as ScoPE2 \citep{Specht2021}, serving as a starting point for customization at multiple levels.

The developed pipeline and user interface serve as valuable tools for individual researchers and research communities, enabling them to analyze and visualize their data in meetings, even on non-performant computers. However, our future perspective involves deploying the application on a server, making it accessible to research groups around the world. This would enhance collaboration and facilitate the sharing of insights and findings across different geographical locations. By providing a centralized platform for proteomics analysis, we aim to foster scientific advancements and enable researchers to make significant contributions to their respective fields. Furthermore by having a central hub for proteomic data analysis and the use of artificial intelligence the biological meaning could be brought to a wider context. Since proteomic data could be saved without violating data protection laws, algorithms could be employed to learn from large datasets.
