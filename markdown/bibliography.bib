Here, we probe the carrier proteome effects in single cell proteomics with mixed species TMTpro-labeled samples. We demonstrate that carrier proteomes, while increasing overall identifications, dictate which proteins are identified. We show that quantitative precision and signal intensity are limited at high carrier levels, hindering the recognition of regulated proteins. Guidelines for optimized mass spectrometry acquisition parameters and best practices for fold-change or protein copy number-based comparisons are provided.</p>},

@book{Parker2010,
   abstract = {"Proteomics" is a word coined in 1994 by Marc Wilkins as an alternative to “the protein complement of the genome” (1). Proteomics is still defined in various ways (2), from “the large-scale analysis of the proteome” to “the simultaneous study of all proteins in the cell.” In this chapter, we define it as the study of proteins and their interactions. Proteomics is a new field—only 10 years old—and the rapid evolution of this field is due in large part to many improvements in mass spectrometry (MS) that have occurred during the past several years. Mass spectrometers do one thing—they measure mass. In proteomics, the mass gives information on the protein identity, its chemical modifications, and its structure. Every mass spectrometer has three main components: a source, an analyzer, and a detector. Mass spectrometers measure masses of charged species, so the source must be able to produce ions, the analyzer must be able to separate these ions based on their mass (or, more accurately, mass-to-charge ratio), and the detector must be able to detect charged particles and then amplify the response to give a measurable signal. In 2002, the award for the Nobel Prize in chemistry was given to two scientists (John Fenn and Koichi Tanaka) responsible for the development of two ionization techniques that have revolutionized biomedical mass spectrometry in general, and proteomics in particular. These two techniques, electrospray (3) and MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) (4) mass spectrometry, were groundbreaking in that they allow the vaporization and ionization (and thus the analysis) of relatively large, non-volatile biomolecules such as proteins and peptides. In addition, simultaneous improvements to and development of mass analyzers and detectors have greatly increased the use of mass spectrometry for biological studies.},

   abstract = {<p> Profiling of mRNA expression is an important method to identify biomarkers but complicated by limited correlations between mRNA expression and protein abundance. We hypothesised that these correlations could be improved by mathematical models based on measuring splice variants and time delay in protein translation. We characterised time-series of primary human naïve CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells during early T helper type 1 differentiation with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry proteomics. We performed computational time-series analysis in this system and in two other key human and murine immune cell types. Linear mathematical mixed time delayed splice variant models were used to predict protein abundances, and the models were validated using out-of-sample predictions. Lastly, we re-analysed RNA-seq datasets to evaluate biomarker discovery in five T-cell associated diseases, further validating the findings for multiple sclerosis (MS) and asthma. The new models significantly out-performing models not including the usage of multiple splice variants and time delays, as shown in cross-validation tests. Our mathematical models provided more differentially expressed proteins between patients and controls in all five diseases. Moreover, analysis of these proteins in asthma and MS supported their relevance. One marker, sCD27, was validated in MS using two independent cohorts for evaluating response to treatment and disease prognosis. In summary, our splice variant and time delay models substantially improved the prediction of protein abundance from mRNA expression in three different immune cell types. The models provided valuable biomarker candidates, which were further validated in MS and asthma. </p>},

@article{Gygi1999,
   abstract = {<p> We have determined the relationship between mRNA and protein expression levels for selected genes expressed in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> growing at mid-log phase. The proteins contained in total yeast cell lysate were separated by high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Over 150 protein spots were excised and identified by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein spots were quantified by metabolic labeling and scintillation counting. Corresponding mRNA levels were calculated from serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) frequency tables (V. E. Velculescu, L. Zhang, W. Zhou, J. Vogelstein, M. A. Basrai, D. E. Bassett, Jr., P. Hieter, B. Vogelstein, and K. W. Kinzler, Cell 88:243–251, 1997). We found that the correlation between mRNA and protein levels was insufficient to predict protein expression levels from quantitative mRNA data. Indeed, for some genes, while the mRNA levels were of the same value the protein levels varied by more than 20-fold. Conversely, invariant steady-state levels of certain proteins were observed with respective mRNA transcript levels that varied by as much as 30-fold. Another interesting observation is that codon bias is not a predictor of either protein or mRNA levels. Our results clearly delineate the technical boundaries of current approaches for quantitative analysis of protein expression and reveal that simple deduction from mRNA transcript analysis is insufficient. </p>},
