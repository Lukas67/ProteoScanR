# Introduction

## Mass Spectrometry



### MS-Spectrum

Every peptide is reflected by its` indivual fingerprint in the ms-spectrum. The fingerprint is based on the chemical properties and modifications. In order to identify proteins, fingerprints are matched against a sequence database \citep{Cox2008}. 



### Interpretation of the data

Since ms data has a high resoultuion, algorithms are used to convert peaks to interpretable form. These algorithms find local minima of the function to seperate peaks from each other. Peaks include all isotopes of the protein`s containing atoms. MaxQuant \citep{Cox2008} is one of the sofware packages to process the data and provides it for further analysis and statistical testing.
