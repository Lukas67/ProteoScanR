# Introduction

## Proteomics

The proteome is referred to the sum of all proteins of a given sample at a given time. In the past several quantitative and qualitative assays were used to enlighten the protein composition of a sample. 

An early approach of qualitative analysis of the cellular proteome involved labeling with fluorescent antibodies and imaging. The major disadvantage of this technique was the limitation to only stain a few proteins per cell. For quantification procedures such as single-cell Western blots, immunoassays or CyTOF have been used. Other disadvantages are the ability to permeate cells, accessibility and binding of the epitope and the creation of specific antibodies for a given protein \citep{Budnik2018}. 

One of those techniques involved RNA-sequencing. Since RNA involves also non-coding RNA, the amount of RNA is often not proportional to the content of proteins in a cell. So the proteinaceous content of a cell was only predicted and quantitative analysis was not possible. 


## Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry enables qualitative and quantitative analysis of the entire repertoire of a biological sample. The availability of gene sequences in databases and the ability to match proteins against those sequences with computational methods makes it possible to identify alterations of a sample on a protein level. These alterations can rely on the sequence level or could be to post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, methylation or else \citep{Aebersold2003}.
